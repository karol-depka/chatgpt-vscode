Print total time in seconds, not ms. Say "goodbye" at the end. Change iteration count from 99 to 3.




 Print result as .patch. Make sure to respect original indentation and update lines when indentation changes.

Don't output any explanation. Just give me the patch.

File: hello.ts:
```
const startTime = Date.now();

for (let i = 1; i <= 99; i++) {
    console.log(`Iteration: ${i}`);
    if (i % 2 === 0) {
        for (let j = 0; j < 7; j++) {
            console.log(`hi`);
        }
    }
}

console.log(`Total time taken: ${Date.now() - startTime}ms`);
```
